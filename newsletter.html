          	<h3>How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy SIII (SGH-T999) FREE without Unlock Code or Rooting</h3>
          	<p>A regular client paid me a visit today. He owns almost every latest gadget, from iPhone 5, iPad, Blackberry z10, and just added a Samsung S III (sgh-t999) to his collection.

Like all his other gadgets, I have to either unlock, Jailbreak, Download applications, sync contacts and show him some tips on how to fully utilize them. Easy-breezy, but there was a problem, I've never Unlocked or Rooted a Samsung Android Device! </p><p>
